In the distant future, Earth had crumbled into dust, and humanity had rebuilt civilization on a floating archipelago of sky-islands known as The Lolliverse. The most precious resource in this world? Not gold, not oil—no, it was Dum Dum suckers.

Tiny, sweet, and suspiciously indestructible, Dum Dums had become the center of power, commerce, and religion. Entire factions had risen to claim them. And war... war was inevitable.

## The Factions

There were four major powers:

The Pop Coven led by the cunning Rhea, whose elite generals included the stealthy Lynnea and the sorceress Zakiya.

The Spiral Syndicate, an empire of steel and sugar, with Alejandro the Tactician, Adrian the Blade, and the silent assassin Landon.

The Free Suckers, a rebel coalition led by Htee, the charismatic ex-Spiral, and her lieutenants: firebrand Avika, the stoic Dharitri, and hacker Amulya.

And finally, The Wrappers, a nomadic tribe sworn to protect the ancient, unwrapped Dum Dums. Their mysterious leader, Bryn, was aided by twin warriors Adrianna and Kota, the wildcard Joey, and priestess Abigail.

Then came the Outliers, rogue agents—Mason, Gavin, David, Evaristo, Scott, Tate, and the elusive Luke—each with their own agenda, shifting alliances, and private stashes of the sacred suckers.

## The Turning Point

It began on Twizzler Ridge, where the Pop Coven had unearthed the legendary Mystery Flavor Vault. Rhea declared a monopoly. Lynnea lit the beacons. Zakiya summoned lightning. The world responded in chaos.

Alejandro launched a coordinated assault from Spiral war balloons, flanked by Adrian’s blade-runners and Landon’s drone battalion. The vault’s sky turned red with neon tracer fire and sucker shards.

But the Free Suckers were already there.

Htee had infiltrated the vault days earlier. Avika had laid sugar-fusion charges. Amulya jammed the Spiral Syndicate's comms, and Dharitri’s mechanical hawks blacked out the sky.

Bryn and the Wrappers arrived with the tide. Adrianna and Kota rode storm beasts, scattering ranks. Joey somersaulted through fire with a jawbreaker launcher. Abigail levitated, whispering ancient Dum Dum hymns, forcing candy to obey her will.

And amid it all, the Outliers acted.

Mason struck a backdoor deal with Spiral for one bag of root beer suckers. Gavin stole it. David betrayed Gavin and threw the suckers into a portal. Evaristo jumped in after them. Scott tried to sell a fake map to the vault. Tate created a hologram of the vault just to watch the factions destroy each other. And Luke?

Luke, having watched it all unfold from a floating recliner with a grape sucker in his mouth, whispered, “They never realized the real vault… was under the Pop Coven’s throne the whole time.”

## Aftermath

The war ended, not with a treaty, but with a laugh.

Luke opened the true Mystery Vault live on holo-stream. Billions watched as he unwrapped… a single, glowing Dum Dum. Its flavor? Undefined. Infinite. Eternal.

Every faction, seeing its radiance, dropped their weapons. For the first time in centuries, they agreed on one thing: no one would taste it.

The Dum Dum was placed in orbit, where it spins still—glowing, untasted, and utterly victorious.

The End... For Now
